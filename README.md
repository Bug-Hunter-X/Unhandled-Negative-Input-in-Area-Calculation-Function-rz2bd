# Unhandled Negative Input in Area Calculation Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: failure to handle negative input values in a function. The `calculateArea` function calculates the area of a rectangle, but doesn't check for negative input, which can lead to unexpected negative area values. The solution provides improved input validation and error handling.
